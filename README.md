# Virtual-Hair

    
 6 months ago, a friend approach me with an idea of an app. With this app, he wanted women to be able to see themselves with a  certain hairstyle of their choosing before going to the salon. (This is all I can disclose) This technological feat could be accomplished 
  with OpenCV, soo I took it upon myself to learn how to use that library. Along with learning Python and OpenGL, I set out to develop a
  proof of concept that is able to project a 3D hair into a smartphone's front camera capture, or in this case the webcam's capture. Through 
  countless all-nighters on a workday, confronting one elusive bug after the next and against all odds, I have completed what I have envisioned 
  when I first started this project. Still there is much to be done until it will be ready. But this small program is a testament to my 
  affinity to perservere through staggering odds and came through, only to find out that its free to just develop it in vulforia with unity. Which is
  what I should've done in the first place.
